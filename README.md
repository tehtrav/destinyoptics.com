If you see a scope that I'm missing and would like to provide your own screenshot, here are the steps to getting a clear image that I can use:

1. Spawn into Venus Patrol, *Do not move at all from the spawn location*
2. Wait until "Patrol mission available" fades away.
3. Point at the center of the triangular crack in the ground towards the path on the left

4. Make sure there are none of the following abnormalities:
    * "Super Charged" HUD message
    * "Patrol Missions available" HUD message
    * Playstation or Xbox notifications (including the screenshot success icon)
    * Other guardians present

5. Take a screenshot while aiming down sites
6. Take a screenshot without aiming down sites
7. Send them to travsellsstuff@gmail.com, without any compression (please don't use imgur)
